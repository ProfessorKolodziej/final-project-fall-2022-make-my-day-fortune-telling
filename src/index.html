				<p class="about-content">
					In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, people feel overwhelmed by work, personal life, and societal expectations. Constant information flow and comparing oneself to others can cause stress and a feeling of being adrift, leading to nervousness and anxiety. People often seek tools or methods to alleviate stress.
	
					With this background, a daily fortune telling application - “Make My Day” is designed. Unlike normal horoscopes or traditional fortune telling apps, it predominantly conveys a positive and empowering concept and provides users with daily guidance to navigate life's complexities.
					
					Make My Day aims to promote positive mindfulness, providing daily inspiration, motivation, and hope. Unlike traditional fortune-telling, it offers insights and humor tips, encouraging users to approach challenges with a positive mindset and a focus on growth.
